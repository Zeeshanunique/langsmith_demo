## Code Readme

This code uses the langchain_openai library to interact with the ChatGPT model.

**Dependencies:**

* langchain_openai
* langchain_core
* os
* dotenv

**Instructions:**

1. Install the dependencies.

2. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI API Key]
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=[Your LangChain API Key]
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

3. Run the code:

```
python main.py
```

**Output:**

The code will print the output of the ChatGPT model for the given prompt and context.

**Prompt:**

The prompt is a template that defines the context and question for the ChatGPT model. In this case, the prompt asks the model to summarize a speech.

**Context:**

The context is a text that provides additional information to the model about the speech. In this case, the context is a speech about India's progress.

**Questions:**

The code defines a question, `question`, and provides the context, `context`, to the model. The model will then generate an answer to the question based on the context.

**Output Parser:**

The code uses the `StrOutputParser` class to parse the model's output. The output parser will convert the model's output into a string.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `load_dotenv()` function is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file.
* The `os.environ` variable is used to set the environment variables for the model and the output parser.
* The `|` operator is used to pipe the prompt, model, and output parser together.
* The `invoke()` method is used to invoke the model with the specified question and context.
